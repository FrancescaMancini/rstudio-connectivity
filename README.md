# Connectivity indicator

The scripts in this repository contain a worflow to design a habitat connectivity indicator.
We generate simulated landscapes and test the performance of different tools on each of the landscapes.
We then evaluate the output from each tool to provide recommendations for the design of a national habitat connectivity indicator.
